# Sonder UI (Work in progress)

> A collection of tested, accessible components and component pattern documentation.

The purpose of this project is to showcase component patterns that have been thoroughly tested for accessibility. Each component's readme includes a description of how it was tested, bugs found, expected functionality, and design considerations for extension or authoring similar patterns.

Each pattern is authored as a web component, and can be dropped directly into a project. However, since this is primarily intended as accessibility documentation + reference implementation, they may not be as fully featured as a true component library.

Suggestions for additional components to include are very welcome; please file an issue.

## Components

- Readonly Select
- Filterable Combobox
- Multiselect
