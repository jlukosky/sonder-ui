# Combobox autoselect active option

A test of an alternative to a native `<select>` that uses `div` with `role="combobox"` with an `<input>` child. Provides filtering. Instead of autocomplete the first matching option is selected.

## Purpose

Custom dropdown selection widgets have historically been difficult to implement in an accessible way. The [ARIA combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox) altered quite a bit from ARIA 1.0 to ARIA 1.1, and browser and assistive tech support is still imperfect.

Another element of confusion comes from the ambiguity of needing to choose between a button/listbox implementation and a combobox implementation. The native `<select>` maps to the former on both macOS and iOS, and to the latter on Windows machines.

The native `<select>` is still a much better choice than any custom element.

- The main complaint with a native `<select>` is that the options menu is not easily styled.
- Custom selection components remain some of the hardest to get right. There was significant change in the pattern between ARIA 1.0 and ARIA 1.1
- macOS and Windows interpret the roles of the native `<select>` differently, which makes it hard to choose which semantic avenue to follow. The ARIA spec comes down on the macOS side, but more screen reader users are on Windows.
- There are widely varying implementations found in the wild, even from accessibility professionals. There does not seem to be a single easy consensus about how to write this, and we still get frequent questions and issues raised about this pattern
